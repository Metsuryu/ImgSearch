# ImgSearch

ImgSearch allows you to search on flickr images who's title, 
description or tags contain the text of the search query. 
You can exclude results that match a term by prepending it with a - character.

To use the app, simply open index.html located in this directory, 
enter any text you wish to search in the "Search" text input, 
and click the "Search" button, or press enter.

The first 25 results will be shown if available, and when scrolling 
to the bottom of the page, additional results will load if any.

Clicking on a picture will dim and disable the background and display 
the highest resolution version available of that picture, the title, 
username of the owner, and description.
The picture can be closed by clicking on the "X" button on 
the top-right of the screen, or by pressing the "Esc" key.

The only third party library that was used is jQuery, 
as it simplifies most of the commonly used functions 
and makes the code more concise and easy to read.
